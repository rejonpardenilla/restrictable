# Restrictable

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/restrictable.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/restrictable)

Manage authorization restrictions on Ruby on Rails with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).
Ideal for controlling actions of 2 or 3 types of users.

Restrict user roles from doing specific actions on the controller with two simple controller helpers:

```ruby
only_allow :cutom_user_role, to: :some_action_in_the_controller
prevent :another_user_role, to: :some_other_action
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'restrictable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Usage

After adding a `User` model with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started), run the following migration:

```
$ rails generate migration AddRoleToUsers role:integer
```

Your migration and model should look like this:

```ruby
class AddRoleToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    add_column :users, :role, :integer, default: 0
  end
end
```

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  devise  :database_authenticatable, :recoverable,
          :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable,

  enum role: [:guest, :content_creator, :admin]
end
```

And now you can take advantage of the simple controller methods:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  only_allow :admin, to: :destroy
  prevent :guest, to: [:create, :update]

  def create
  end

  def update
  end

  def destroy
  end
end
```

## Advanced Usage

Additionally you can match your implementation with `Restrictable` simply overriding controller methods. You can do this on the `ApplicationController` level or in your Controller.

#### Example of use:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
  before_action :authenticate_user!

  # `on_forbidden_action` is called when a user role doesn't have
  # permission to access the controller method.
  def on_forbidden_action
    head :forbidden
  end

  # `should_prevent?(role)` is used to check when a role should be
  # prevented.
  # Called by the `prevent` helper and should return a boolean value.
  def should_prevent?(role)
    current_user.role == role
  end

  # `should_only_allow?(role)` is used to check when a role should be
  # allowed.
  # Called by the `only_allow` helper and should return a boolean value.
  def should_only_allow?(role)
    current_user.role != role
  end
end
```

For example, if we want to implement `Restrictable` on an application that already have implemented users roles with the model `Seller` with devise and the attribute `responsability`. Our controller will be something like this:

```ruby
class SellersController < ApplicationController
  only_allow :national_seller, to: :delete
  prevent :local_seller, to: :new, :update

  def should_prevent?(role)
    @seller.responsability == role
  end

  def should_only_allow?(role)
    @seller.responsability != role
  end

  # ...
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies and migrate test database. Then, run `bin/test` or `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
